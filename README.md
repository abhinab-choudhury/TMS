### 🛠️ **Technologies Used**

#### 🔧 Frontend Stack

* **HTML5**: Semantic structure and layout of the application.
* **CSS3** (Inline + Bootstrap): For responsive design, visual aesthetics, and utility classes.
* **Bootstrap 5**: Used for grid system, UI components like modals, buttons, alerts, and form styling.
* **jQuery**: DOM manipulation, event handling, animations, and AJAX calls for smooth interactivity.
* **RichTextEditor.js**: Enables users to write detailed task descriptions with formatting (bold, links, images, lists, etc.).

#### 🧠 Backend (BaaS)

* **Appwrite**:

  * **Authentication**: Account management and user sessions.
  * **Database**: Stores all task-related information including titles, descriptions, dates, and priority.
  * **Permissions**: Role-based access control (RBAC) using Appwrite's built-in Permission and Role APIs.
  * **API Client SDK**: All interactions with the Appwrite server (creating, reading, updating, deleting documents) are done through the official Appwrite JavaScript SDK.
